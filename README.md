# Multi-Omics-Analysis-of-TP53
Objective : Analyze TP53 mutations using NGS data, integrate RNA-Seq gene expression  data, and apply AI/ML models for insights

# Genomics and data retrieval
Tools: NCBI, Ensembl, UCSC Genome Browser, Galaxy 
1. Retrieve Genomic Data:  
o Download TP53 gene sequence from NCBI Gene Database. 
o Extract mutations from dbSNP or COSMIC Mutation Database. 
2. Obtain Cancer Datasets:  
o Download TP53 mutation datasets from TCGA (via UCSC Xena 
or GDC Data Portal). 
o RNA-Seq data for cancer types (e.g., Lung, Breast, Colon, etc.)

# NGS Variant Calling Pipeline
A comprehensive, modular pipeline for calling variants from next-generation sequencing (NGS) data. This pipeline streamlines the analysis from raw sequencing reads to annotated variant calls, making it easier to integrate into your bioinformatics workflows

# Overview
The NGS Variant Calling Pipeline automates the key steps in variant analysis, including:

Quality Control: Assessing raw read quality (e.g., using FastQC).
Read Alignment: Mapping reads to a reference genome (e.g., using BWA or Bowtie).
Post-processing: Sorting, indexing, and marking duplicates (e.g., with Samtools and Picard).
Variant Calling: Identifying single nucleotide variants and indels (e.g., using GATK or FreeBayes).
Annotation: Adding biological context to identified variants (e.g., using GATK).
This pipeline is designed with modularity and reproducibility in mind, allowing you to easily customize and extend its functionality.
# Features
Modular Design: Swap out or add tools based on your needs.
Automation: End-to-end processing from raw data to variant reports.
Scalability: Suitable for both small datasets and large-scale studies.
Reproducibility: Configuration files and version control ensure that analyses can be replicated.

# Requirements
Operating System: Linux-based systems (tested on Ubuntu)
Programming Language: Python 3.6 or higher
Tools:
Git
FastQC
Samtools
Picard
GATK or FreeBayes
